Code used for measurement of W boson polarization (helicity) fractions in top quark pair decays

- templateFitting/ contains the statistical machinery used to perform a bin-by-bin template likelihood fit to extract the numbers of top quark decays split by helicity fraction. Some elements of the code were produced in collaboration, but many key components, wrappers, and steering scripts were written by me
